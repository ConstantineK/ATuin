# A'Tuin

    A mighty name for a tiny SQL Server and PowerShell module.

## Why

    I want a light weight PowerShell and .NET friendly set of code which:
        # Enables my PowerShell and SQL Server focused workflow
        # Runs queries without hassle
        ## PRINT, SQL errors, statistics io, etc
        ## Handles parameters and non queries
        # Runs things in parallel
        # Starts up insanely fast
        # Only contains what I need
        # Is pretty dang stable

## What

    Connections
    Queries
    Parallelism
