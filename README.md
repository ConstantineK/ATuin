# Why
    While I wait for PowerShell Core to catch up (in a lot of ways) so I can hack on a cross platform toolkit I want a light weight PowerShell and .NET friendly set of code which:
        # Enables my PowerShell and SQL Server focused workflow
        # Runs queries without hassle
        ## Returns things like PRINT statements without hassle
        ## Returns SQL errors
        ## Handles parameters and non queries
        # Runs things in parallel
        # Starts up insanely fast
        # Only contains what I need
        # Is a PS Module
        # Is easily hackable

# What 
    Connections
    Queries 
    Backups
